New repository for the software engineering assignment (original repo had a bad merge that we couldn't roll back).

The project is to create an employee fatigue management system, utilising reaction-based games to monitor employee fatigue levels.

We are using the Next.js React framework to build the frontend. Currently the backend checks are being faked.
